# WebView2 Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the React UI with your .NET Windows application using WebView2.

## Step 1: Build the React Application

1. Build the React application to generate static files:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a `dist` folder with all the static files (HTML, CSS, JS).

## Step 2: Set Up WebView2 in Your .NET Application

1. Install the WebView2 NuGet package in your Windows Forms or WPF project:
   ```
   Install-Package Microsoft.Web.WebView2
   ```

2. Create a folder in your .NET project for the React build output:
   ```
   YourProject/
   ├── WebResources/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   ├── assets/
   │   └── ...
   ```

3. Set these files as embedded resources in Visual Studio:
   - Right-click on each file/folder
   - Properties
   - Set "Build Action" to "Embedded Resource"

## Step 3: Load the React App in WebView2

Use the provided `DotNetSample.cs` as a reference for:
1. Initializing WebView2
2. Loading the embedded resources
3. Handling communication between .NET and the React app

Key components to implement:

- Message handling between WebView2 and React
- Authentication flow
- Security measures for the communication

## Step 4: Authentication Implementation

The `.NET` side should implement:

1. User authentication logic
2. Token generation and validation
3. Secure storage of credentials

The React side already has:
1. Login UI
2. Token management
3. Secure communication

## Step 5: Building the Final Executable

1. Make sure all React resources are embedded in the .NET project
2. Configure the build process to produce a single executable
3. Set the correct application icon and manifest
4. Consider using a splash screen during initialization

## Security Considerations

1. Validate all messages from the WebView2
2. Use encrypted communication
3. Implement proper authentication
4. Disable unnecessary WebView2 features
5. Consider code signing the final executable

## Testing the Integration

1. Test authentication flow
2. Verify all features work when integrated
3. Check security of the communication
4. Verify performance with embedded resources

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
1. Missing embedded resources
2. CORS issues during development
3. WebView2 runtime not installed
4. Communication errors between .NET and React

## Sample Code

See `DotNetSample.cs` for a complete implementation example.
