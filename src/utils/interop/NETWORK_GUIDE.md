# Networking Integration Guide for .NET Windows Applications

## Overview
This document provides guidance on securely integrating the React UI with a .NET application while minimizing detection risks.

## Host Setup Recommendations

### Recommended Hosting Options

1. **Localhost Hosting**
   - Host the React app locally on the same machine as the .NET application
   - Avoids external network traffic completely
   - Communication happens entirely within the local machine

2. **Embedded Resources**
   - Bundle the React app as embedded resources in the .NET application
   - No network calls required for loading the UI
   - Use WebView2 or similar for rendering

3. **Local Network Server**
   - Host on a local network if multiple machines need access
   - Use HTTPS with self-signed certificates
   - Restrict access with authentication

4. **Self-contained Application**
   - Package everything in a single self-contained application
   - No external dependencies or API calls
   - All communication contained within application boundaries

## Network Security Best Practices

1. **Avoid External APIs**
   - Keep all communication local or within your controlled network
   - Any external API calls can be intercepted or monitored
   - If external APIs are needed, route them through your .NET backend, not directly from the UI

2. **Communication Protocol Security**
   - Use encrypted local communication (HTTPS even for localhost)
   - Implement additional application-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Randomize communication patterns to avoid detection

3. **DMA Hardware Integration**
   - Ensure all DMA hardware communications happen exclusively on the .NET side
   - Never expose DMA addresses or operations to the React frontend
   - Create abstraction layers to decouple UI from hardware operations

4. **Localhost Communication Only**
   - Restrict all network interfaces to localhost (127.0.0.1)
   - Block outbound connections in the system firewall for your application
   - Use Windows DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) to restrict network access

5. **Avoid Standard Patterns**
   - Don't use standard WebSocket connection patterns
   - Avoid predictable request timing or intervals
   - Randomize message sizes and formats to avoid fingerprinting

## Connection Security 

1. **WebView2 Integration**
   - Use WebView2's built-in postMessage mechanism for .NET communication
   - Implement callback objects for direct function calls
   - Enable context isolation to prevent external access

2. **Connection Obfuscation**
   - Rename standard objects and methods to avoid detection
   - Use multiple fallback communication channels
   - Implement custom encoding for message payloads

3. **Anti-Detection Measures**
   - Randomize heartbeat intervals (don't use fixed timing)
   - Add jitter to all network operations
   - Monitor for debugging or inspection attempts

## Implementation Guide

### .NET Host Application

1. **WebView2 Setup**
   ```csharp
   // Create WebView2 instance with proper isolation
   await webView.EnsureCoreWebView2Async();
   webView.CoreWebView2.Settings.AreDevToolsEnabled = false;
   webView.CoreWebView2.Settings.AreDefaultScriptDialogsEnabled = false;
   webView.CoreWebView2.Settings.IsScriptEnabled = true;
   webView.CoreWebView2.Settings.AreBrowserAcceleratorKeysEnabled = false;
   
   // Register message handlers
   webView.CoreWebView2.WebMessageReceived += HandleWebMessage;
   
   // Load local content
   webView.CoreWebView2.Navigate("file:///path/to/app/index.html");
   // or
   webView.CoreWebView2.NavigateToString(embeddedHtmlContent);
   ```

2. **Message Handling**
   ```csharp
   private void HandleWebMessage(object sender, CoreWebView2WebMessageReceivedEventArgs e)
   {
       try
       {
           string message = e.WebMessageAsJson;
           // Process message...
           
           // Send response
           webView.CoreWebView2.PostWebMessageAsJson(responseJson);
       }
       catch (Exception ex)
       {
           // Handle error...
       }
   }
   ```

### React Integration

1. Ensure all communication goes through our InteropService
2. Implement message encryption for sensitive data
3. Always check for established connection before attempting communication
4. Use fallback mechanisms when primary communication channel fails

## Deployment

1. **Self-contained Executable**
   - Package the React app with the .NET application
   - Use tools like Electron.NET or similar for complete packaging
   - Sign your executable with a valid certificate

2. **Local Installation**
   - Install only on local machine
   - No internet connection requirements
   - Use relative paths for all resources

3. **Updates**
   - Implement manual updates rather than auto-updates
   - Never contact external servers for update checks
   - Package updates as full applications, not patches

## Testing Security

1. Monitor all network traffic using tools like Wireshark
2. Test with various security products to ensure low detection profile
3. Verify all communication is properly obfuscated and encrypted

## Troubleshooting

1. If connection issues occur, verify that WebView2 Runtime is installed
2. Check for firewall rules blocking localhost communication
3. Verify appropriate permissions for the application
