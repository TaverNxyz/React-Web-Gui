# Integration Steps for Windows Forms Application

## Step 1: Required NuGet Packages

Install these NuGet packages in your Windows Forms project:
```
Install-Package Microsoft.Web.WebView2
Install-Package System.Text.Json
```

## Step 2: Project Structure

Create these folders in your .NET project:
- WebResources (for React build files)
- Resources (for splash screen and other images)

## Step 3: Add Splash Screen Image

1. Add your splash screen image to the Resources folder
2. Set its Build Action to "Embedded Resource"
3. The resource path should be "YourNamespace.Resources.splash.png"

## Step 4: React App Build

1. Run `npm run build` to generate the React build files
2. Copy the build files (index.html, js, css, and assets) to the WebResources folder
3. Set all these files to have Build Action "Embedded Resource"

## Step 5: Configure Resource Names

If your namespace is not "imperium.tech", modify these resource paths in MainForm.cs:
- `imperium.tech.Resources.splash.png`
- `imperium.tech.WebResources.index.html`

## Step 6: Create Windows Forms Project

1. Create a new Windows Forms project
2. Copy Program.cs and MainForm.cs to your project
3. Create a MainForm.Designer.cs file (can be auto-generated by Visual Studio)
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT implement InitializeComponent in MainForm.cs - let it be generated in MainForm.Designer.cs
5. Make sure the class declaration is `public partial class MainForm : Form`

## Step 7: Add Manifest Resources

In your .csproj file, verify that embedded resources are correctly included:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <EmbeddedResource Include="Resources\splash.png" />
  <EmbeddedResource Include="WebResources\**\*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Step 8: Build and Run

Build and run your application. The MainForm will:
1. Show the splash screen
2. Initialize WebView2 after a delay
3. Load your React app from embedded resources
4. Handle communication between React and .NET

## Troubleshooting

1. If resources aren't found, check:
   - Correct namespace in resource paths
   - Build Action is set to "Embedded Resource"
   - Files are actually in your project
   
2. If WebView2 fails to initialize:
   - Ensure WebView2 Runtime is installed
   - Check error messages in console output

3. For JSON parsing errors:
   - Make sure System.Text.Json is properly referenced
   - Check that message format matches expected structure

4. For InitializeComponent errors:
   - Make sure you're using `public partial class MainForm : Form`
   - Do NOT implement InitializeComponent in MainForm.cs
   - Let Visual Studio generate the MainForm.Designer.cs file
